        <h1>Ursula K. Le Guin: A Rant About “Technology”</h1>
        <h2><a href="http://ursulakleguinarchive.com/Note-Technology.html">Reading link</a></h2>
        <p>What is technology and how do we define technology in our daily lives? In the essay, A Rant About “Technology”, Ursula K. Le Guin brings up common misperceptions of technology we often face. Just because a technology isn’t complex and “hi” doesn’t mean that it is something that we should overlook and misinterpret. Whether a technology is “hi” or “low”, it serves purpose in its own special ways and therefore must be respected. Moreover, technology is anything that we, humans, actively interact with the material world.

        <p>In the essay, Laurel Schwulst encourages individuals to guide the web’s future. Instead of being powered by big corporations, there needs to be a space where individuals can pour out their creativity. As Laurel stated in her essay, “A website can be anything.”, a website should be a personal space where you’re not bound by anything and a way to express yourself. Let it be a living space that gradually grows from the seed of inspiration!</p>

        <h1>J. R. Carpenter: A Handmade web
        </h1>
        <h2><a href="http://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html">Reading Link</a></h2>
        <p>J. R. Carpenter evokes the term ‘handmade web’ to bring attention to the unique, personalization of the web pages coded by hands rather than by software. Instead of web pages made and maintained by businesses or corporations, Carpenter emphasizes the value of handmade web pages that often challenge our common understanding of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity. Some questions that came to my mind: How do we connect with handmade webs? What value do they bring? What does it take to build them?</p>
